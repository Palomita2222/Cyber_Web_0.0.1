For this to work, you will need to update your chrome and install the latest chromedriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

If the chrome version has not changed, the driver is already in the repo.

To execute, you will also need the latest version of PYTHON 3 (ADD TO PATH IN INSTALATION)

When executed, you will be prompted with some imputs saying :
  Email:
  Password for server:
  URL:
  
  The email does not need to be real
  The pass needs to be at least 6 chars
  The URL may or may not be taken
  The URL has a watermark since this is a free service we are using.
